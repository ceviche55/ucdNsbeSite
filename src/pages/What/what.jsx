                <p><b>History and Founding of NSBE: </b>The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) was founded in 1975 by a group of six African American engineering students at Purdue University. The founding members were Edward Coleman, Brian Harris, Stanley Kirtley, John Logan, Anthony Harris, and George Smith. They came together to support each other as minority students within the College of Engineering at Purdue and to encourage other African American students to pursue careers in engineering. NSBE was formally established as a national organization in 1976 and held its first national conference in 1977. Since its founding, NSBE has grown to become one of the largest student-managed organizations in the country.</p>
                <p><b>Mission and Goals of NSBE: </b>The mission of NSBE is "to increase the number of culturally responsible black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community." NSBE aims to support and promote the aspirations of collegiate and pre-collegiate students pursuing careers in STEM. Key goals include developing and implementing initiatives to support member professional development, increase member participation in technical societies, and promote opportunities for leadership training. Additionally, NSBE works to build a strong pipeline by engaging students at the pre-college level and helping them pursue engineering careers. The organization also strives to provide networking and career opportunities for its members.</p>

                <p><b>Programs and Initiatives of NSBE: </b>NSBE has developed various programs and initiatives to fulfill its mission and goals over the years. A major program is the Pre-College Initiative (PCI) which provides programming and resources to middle school and high school students interested in STEM careers. The NSBE Professionals initiative connects student members to industry professionals to provide mentoring and networking opportunities. NSBE also organizes an Annual Convention which brings together thousands of members for career fairs, networking events, workshops and more. Regional conferences and local chapter meetings further provide development and community-building opportunities. Additionally, NSBE manages various scholarships such as the Bridge Scholarship Program to support minority students in pursuing engineering degrees.</p>
                <p><b>Impact and Acheivements of NSBE: </b>Over the past 40+ years, NSBE has grown to have a substantial impact in supporting and advancing black engineers. It now has over 600 chapters and close to 30,000 members, making it one of the largest student-governed organizations based in the U.S. NSBE has awarded over $5 million in scholarships to enable black engineering students to complete their studies. Notable NSBE alumni include astronaut Mae Jemison, former NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, and actor Janelle Monae. The success of NSBE alumni highlights the organization's effectiveness in building a strong pipeline and network. Overall, NSBE has succeeded in creating a supportive community and expanding opportunities for black students and professionals in the engineering field.</p>
