# CU Denver NSBE Website

This repository contains the source code for the CU Denver National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) chapter website. The website aims to provide information about the chapter, its events, membership, and resources for current and prospective members.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or later, usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arsetufa/CU_DENVER_NSBE.git
```
2. Change to the project directory:

cd CU_DENVER_NSBE
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```bash

The website should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar URL, depending on your configuration).
